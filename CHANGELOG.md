    ```php
    [
        'id' => $userId,
        'ipAddress' => '',
        'userAgent' => '',
        // For pre-segmentation in campaigns
        'customVariables' => [ 'variable' => 'value' ]
    ]

### Added

- First release of VWO Feature Management and Experimentation capabilities.

        'accountId' => 'vwo_account_id',
    ]);

    // set user context
    $userContext = [ 'id' => 'unique_user_id'];

    // returns a flag object
    $getFlag = $vwoClient->getFlag('feature_key', $userContext);

    // check if flag is enabled
    $isFlagEnabled = $getFlag['isEnabled'];

    // get variable
    $variableValue = $getFlag->getVariable('stringVar', 'default-value');

    // track event
    $trackRes = $vwoClient->trackEvent('event-name', $userContext);

    // set Attribute
    $setAttribute = $vwoClient->setAttribute('attribute-name', 'attribute-value', $userContext);
